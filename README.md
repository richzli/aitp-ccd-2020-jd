# FarmAssist

For this challenge we decided to build a map visualization using leaflet.js.

Data was obtained from MSU's Kellogg Biological Station at this link: <https://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datasets/40>.

Sample datasets are already in the repository. To operate, just upload one of those files and click the "Start Simulation" button.

There is also a path tracing option. You can click to create a combine path to simulate a harvest.
